# Fundamental-Analysis-Of-Stocks

The project was intended to introduce financial analysis of a stock using its fundamentals. It began with a fundamental exercise to critically analyze startups as well as business in our locality, submitted as assignment 1.
  We had to understand basics of all the financial statements, how they are built and what basic hindsight about them. Then we were alloted a company for each group consisting 2 students. Our company was HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd.

The subjective analysis of the company on basis of various ratios is included in the ppt, the quantitative analysis is performed using DFC evaluation model, which includes using CAPM model for prediction of cost of equity, WACC as predicted growth rate and other values from financial reports of the firm.
Our conclusion on basis of the DCF model says.....HDFC Life stock is overvalued and one should sell it rather than buying. :)
